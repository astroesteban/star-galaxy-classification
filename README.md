# Star vs Galaxy Classification

A machine learning project demonstrating the classification of images between
stars and galaxies.

## Description

This project is a small demonstration of using a convolutional neural network
to classify a dummy dataset of star and galaxy images. The purpose is to simply
demonstrate good enough classification metrics for even a dataset with 4,000
images using the [Fast.AI](https://www.fast.ai) library.

See the [jupyter notebook](./star_galaxy_classification.ipynb) for more details.
